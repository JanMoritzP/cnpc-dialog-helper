# cnpc-dialog-helper (WIP)
Do you like custom-npc's but also dislike the in-game dialog editor?

Then look no further!

cnpc-dialog-helper is a GUI written in python aimed at eliminating the shortcomings of the in-game GUI to create a smooth dialog editing an creation process

## Running the program

You can either download the .exe (which probably only run on windows)

Or you can pull the entire repo and run the main.py file with python3. Keep in mind that you need tkinter installed in order for this program to run

You need to put either the .exe file or the program into the root folder of the custom npc mod (So that there is a dialogs folder) for the program to work correctly
