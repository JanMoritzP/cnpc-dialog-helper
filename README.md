# cnpc-dialog-helper (WIP)
Do you like custom-npc's but also dislike the in-game dialog editor?

Then look no further!

cnpc-dialog-helper is a GUI written in python aimed at eliminating the shortcomings of the in-game GUI to create a smooth dialog editing an creation process

## Running the program

You can either download the .exe (which is not uploaded right now, but will be uploaded in the future)

Or you can pull the entire repo and run the main.py file with python3. Keep in mind that you need tkinter installed in order for this program to run

You need to put either the .exe file or the program into the root folder of the custom npc mod (So that there is a dialogs folder) for the program to work correctly

## Current Features

- You are able to visualise the dialogs by moving them around any way you want and hit save. They will load up like that again, the next time you run the program
- You can edit the dialog title and text of each dialog
- You can edit the dialog connections
- You can make new dialogs and new dialog folders
- You can remove dialog folders

## Future Features

- You will be able to remove single dialogs
