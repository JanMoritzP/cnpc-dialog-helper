# cnpc-dialog-helper (WIP)
Do you like custom-npc's but also dislike the in-game dialog editor?

Then look no further!

cnpc-dialog-helper is a GUI written in python aimed at eliminating the shortcomings of the in-game GUI to create a smooth dialog editing an creation process

## Running the program

To run this program, you need to clone this repository to your local machine. Then, copy the dialogs folder from custom-npc into the root of this project. 
Run python main.py (or python3 main.py) while tkinter is installed and the program should run nicely

## Current Features

- You are able to visualise the dialogs by moving them around any way you want and hit save. They will load up like that again, the next time you run the program
- You can edit the dialog title and text of each dialog
- You can edit the dialog connections
- You can make new dialogs and new dialog folders
- You can remove dialog folders
- You can remove single dialogs (their references to other dialogs will be automatically deleted as well)
